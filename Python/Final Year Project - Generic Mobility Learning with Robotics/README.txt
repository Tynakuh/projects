Final Year Project for Queen Mary University:

An algorithm designed to learn to move any given number of servos in any given environment in order to attain optimal movement.
This is achieved using an artificial neural network and a genetic learning algorithm applied on top with various optimizations
to improve performance for the specific task at hand.
